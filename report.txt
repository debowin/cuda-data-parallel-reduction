Data Parallel Reduction

1.  How many times does your thread block synchronize to reduce its portion
    of an array to a single value?
    The thread block synchronizes once per stride and since there are log2(n) strides for n = block_size
    elements, the synchronization happens log2(n) times plus one extra time after loading the shared memory elements.
    For a thread block of size 256, it would be 9 times.


2.  What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations
    that a thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly
    contribute to the final reduction value, i.e., iterations of the reduction
    computation.
    Minimum number of real operations would be one, that half the thread block would perform.
    Maximum number would be log2(n) where n is the block size, that the first thread would perform.
    Average number would be sum(i/2^i) over i from 1 to log2(n)
